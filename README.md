# Spring Boot Todo Application
### Description
The Spring Boot Todo Application is a web server built using the Spring Boot framework. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to efficiently manage and organize the codebase. The main workflow of the application involves user registration and authentication in the security part, which then allows users to perform various tasks related to managing their to-do list.

###Layers
#####Controller Layer
The Controller Layer serves as the entry point for handling user requests and managing the application's flow. It receives incoming HTTP requests from clients and delegates them to the appropriate methods in the Service Layer. Additionally, the Controller Layer is responsible for preparing and sending back HTTP responses to the clients. By separating these responsibilities, the Controller ensures clean code organization and promotes loose coupling with other layers.

#####Service Layer
The Service Layer is where the business logic of the application resides. It receives requests from the Controller Layer and processes them according to the application's requirements. This layer acts as an intermediary between the Controller Layer and the DAO (Data Access Object) Layer, abstracting away the data access details. It is responsible for handling complex operations, validation, and coordinating data manipulation.

#####DAO (Data Access Object) Layer
The DAO Layer is responsible for interacting with the underlying MySQL database. It provides methods for storing and retrieving data, and it encapsulates the database-specific operations. By using this layer, we achieve separation of concerns and enable easier database access and maintenance. The DAO Layer is closely connected with the Service Layer, supplying the necessary data to fulfill user requests.

###Security
The application implements security measures to protect sensitive data and restrict unauthorized access. It uses a security filter chain with JWT (JSON Web Token) to authenticate and authorize users. After successful registration and login, users are issued a JWT token, which they include in subsequent requests. The server validates this token to ensure the user is authorized to perform specific actions. By employing JWT, the application ensures stateless authentication and enhances security.

###Testing
The project's functionality is thoroughly tested using JUnit testing. The JUnit tests cover different scenarios, including positive and negative test cases, to validate the correct behavior of the application. Automated testing with JUnit ensures that any changes or updates to the codebase do not introduce unintended bugs or regressions.

###Conclusion
The Spring Boot Todo Application provides a well-structured, secure, and tested solution for managing a to-do list. By following the MVC architecture, the application separates concerns and enhances maintainability. The Security part employing JWT ensures proper authentication and authorization for users, and the JUnit testing guarantees the robustness of the application's features.
